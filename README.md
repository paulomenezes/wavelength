# Wavelength

Wavelength is an AI-powered podcast assistant that helps users discover, explore, and interact with podcasts in a smarter and more personal way. Instead of browsing endless lists, users can ask natural questions like “What are the best tech podcasts?” or “What did they say about Trump last week?” and Wavelength will understand and respond using real-time data and advanced language models. The platform offers powerful features such as personalized podcast search by name, genre, or description, the ability to favorite episodes, sync listening progress across devices, and filter episodes by program or day of the week they were released.
